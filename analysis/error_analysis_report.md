## Root Cause Analysis

### Connection refused: service unreachable (5 occurrences)

**Potential Causes:**
- Downstream service is down
- Network connectivity issues
- Service overloaded and rejecting connections

**Remediation Steps:**
- Implement circuit breaker pattern
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Scale downstream services

### Internal server error: out of memory exception (3 occurrences)

**Potential Causes:**
- Memory leak in application
- Insufficient heap size configuration
- Large data processing without streaming

**Remediation Steps:**
- Increase JVM heap size
- Implement memory profiling
- Review and optimize memory-intensive operations

### Internal server error: database connection pool exhausted (3 occurrences)

**Potential Causes:**
- Connection leak in application code
- Pool size too small for load
- Long-running queries blocking connections

**Remediation Steps:**
- Increase connection pool size
- Implement connection timeout
- Review query performance and optimize slow queries

### Request timeout: upstream service unavailable (4 occurrences)

**Potential Causes:**
- Upstream service responding slowly
- Network latency issues
- Resource contention

**Remediation Steps:**
- Increase timeout thresholds
- Implement async processing
- Add caching layer

## Impact Assessment

- **Overall Error Rate:** 15.0%
- **Estimated User Impact:** HIGH

### Most Affected Endpoints

| Endpoint | Error Count |
|----------|-------------|
| /api/reports | 5 |
| /api/search | 2 |
